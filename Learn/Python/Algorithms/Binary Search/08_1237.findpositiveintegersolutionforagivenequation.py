Problem 1237. Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation

Input:
1. function f(x,y)
2. z

Output:
1. all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z

Constraints:
1. 1 <= function_id <= 9
2. 1 <= z <= 100
3. It is guaranteed that the solutions of f(x, y) == z will be in the range 1 <= x, y <= 1000.
4. It is also guaranteed that f(x, y) will fit in 32 bit signed integer if 1 <= x, y <= 1000.
